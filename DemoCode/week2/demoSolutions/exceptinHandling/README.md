# CS202-Lab4

## Lab Goals
The goal of this Lab is to:
1.	Familiarize students with using **exceptions**.
2.	Familiarize students with using the **const** keyword.
### Important Notes:
1.	**Comments**: Header comments are required on all files and recommended for the rest of the program. Points will be deducted if no header comments are included.
## Program
My favorite books!

**The program should behave as follows:**  
The files have been provided for a complete Book Store project. Please compile and run it to verify everything works. Your job is to find two errors and fix them. 

### Step 1
Try to compile the program. What error do you see? Modify the appropriate files to eliminate the error.

### Step 2
The program should compile now, but you should encounter a run time error. Modify the appropriate file to eliminate the error (without eliminating any existing code).

## Requirements
The required functionality is present, there are just a couple of little errors which prevent the setPrice function in the main driver from working. That function depends on some class functions which need to be modified slightly to be able to compile.  

There is also a run time error hidden in the main driver. Add the necessary code (without removing any of the existing code) so the program handles the error gracefully.

## Submission details
To submit your project, you will have to use git on your VirtualBox installation:
1.	After accepting the assignment invitation, copy the clone URL
2.	Type 
```git clone clone_URL```
3.	cd into your new assignment directory
4.	After working on your files
5.	When you’re ready, type the following commands: 
```
git add .
git commit -m “your commit message”
git push
```
## Academic Honesty
Academic dishonesty is against university as well as the system community standards. Academic dishonesty includes, but is not limited to, the following:
Plagiarism: defined as submitting the language, ideas, thoughts or work of another as one's own; or assisting in the act of plagiarism by allowing one's work to be used in this fashion.
Cheating: defined as (1) obtaining or providing unauthorized information during an examination through verbal, visual or unauthorized use of books, notes, text and other materials; (2) obtaining or providing information concerning all or part of an examination prior to that examination; (3) taking an examination for another student, or arranging for another person to take an exam in one's place; (4) altering or changing test answers after submittal for grading, grades after grades have been awarded, or other academic records once these are official.
Cheating, plagiarism or otherwise obtaining grades under false pretenses constitute academic
dishonesty according to the code of this university. Academic dishonesty will not be tolerated and
penalties can include cancelling a student’s enrolment without a grade, giving an F for the course, or for the assignment. For more details, see the University of Nevada, Reno General Catalog.
